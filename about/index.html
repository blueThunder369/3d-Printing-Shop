<p>
I am a 14 years and I am in high school. I want to start a business because I think that
young people should learn how to become an entrepreneur at a young age. I sold phone stands on Facebook 
market place and now I have decided to move to my own website that I created by myself. 
I have also decided sell more items now other than just phone stands like figits.
